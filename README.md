# docker-goofys-catfs

This is a barebones image if you need a container set up to use 
both [goofys](https://github.com/kahing/goofys) and/or [catfs](https://github.com/kahing/catfs)

There's not many situation where you would need this, but maybe it
serves as a base image, or, like me, you need a container to pull from a bucket
to move into another one.

In any case, it's somewhat useless and useful at the same time /shrug
